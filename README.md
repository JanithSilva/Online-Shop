The online shop is developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, providing a range of features for both customers and administrators. Customers have the ability to create an account, manage their shopping cart by adding or removing items, update cart information, proceed to checkout, place orders, and access their order history. Administrators can manage orders and update product details. The system follows the MVC design pattern, with server-side rendering of views using EJS templating engine. When you make an order through the app, you will be directed to Stripe checkout in test mode. This allows you to simulate a purchase using test card numbers. However, for a production app, live mode will be employed, utilizing the publishable and secret keys specific to the live mode.
